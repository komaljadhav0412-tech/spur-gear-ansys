Spur Gear Stress Analysis (ANSYS)
📌 Overview
This project performs Finite Element Analysis (FEA) on spur gears using ANSYS Workbench 2025 R1 (Student Version).
The study focuses on stress distribution, deformation, and strain under applied loads.

🛠 Tools & Setup
Software: ANSYS Workbench 2025 R1
Material: Structural Steel
Boundary Conditions:
 Fixed support on one gear hub
 Force applied on mating gear teeth
Mesh: Tetrahedral, refined at contacts

📊 Key Results
Max Equivalent Stress: 1.434 × 10⁷ Pa
Min Stress: 281.55 Pa
Stress concentrated at gear tooth root

🚀 Applications
Gearbox design & optimization
Fatigue & failure analysis
Predictive maintenance
